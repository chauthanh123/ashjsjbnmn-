<p>“The way this story started sounds quite absurd.”</p>
<p>A wilderness place, a night of full moon, in the shrine that had been abandoned for a long time, someone sighed faintly.</p>
<p>The wind of the autumn blew through the cracks of the wall and the windows, the light of the half-burned candle kept moving from side to side. Even the elders of the village still had no idea about how long this place had been existing, but tonight, there would be many dark shadows coming there.</p>
<p>The candlelight shone into a protruding mouth, long ears, thick tail, bruised sharp fingers which were stained with blood, and the dark eyes that looked too bizarre to believe they belonged to human. That statue's face of the mountain god was covered in dust  for many years, which made it hard to recognise him, but in a glimpse, the face became more hideous, making the bleak moonlight looked deeply cruel that couldn’t distinguish whether that was a god or a demon.</p>
<p>“It was about the heavenly emperor from Lingxiao palace…”</p>
<p>The voice came from a guy in a white cloth, who was lying under the statue. He slightly raised his head, the glimmering light shone into his face, his grey eyes had a reflection of those rainy clouds that were far away from the sky, the scarlet lips curled up to make a teasing smile. A group of ghosts gathered around him, his glorious face, which was charming as a woman, making anyone felt goosebumps from the bottom of their hearts.</p>
<p>The wind was blowing stronger, the moon had disappeared. In this devastated, broken shrine, Yangui, wearing his well-sketched skin, was telling everyone a little-known myth:</p>
<p>“Once upon a time, that was when the emperor had just created his own kingdom, which has become unknown nowadays, the true dragon king of our previous dynasty, at that time, was only a hunter travelling through some mountains. This amorous emperor was meeting the Chang-e lady privately at Guanghan palace. And when their love and heat were intensely intertwined, suddenly, he heard the sound of the drums and music, it was because… his wife, the heavenly empress, was coming there drastically. While being too panicked, the emperor, regardless of his majesty as the king of heaven, turned into a rabbit, jumping out of the window, escaping to the mortal world.</p>
<p>That day, it was the hunter’s predetermined fate to become wealthy. The rabbit that the emperor had turned into, coincidentally, fell into his trap, even then, while being too hurry to escape, the rabbit’s leg was stabbed by a piece of bamboo. He really wanted to cast some spells to deal with the hunter, but he was afraid it would cause his wife to find him. Finally, he couldn’t find any way.</p>
<p>The hunter had been living in poverty for the half of his life in the forest, so of course, he felt stunned after seeing the blood of the rabbit. </p>
<p>Since then, there have been many different opinions about what had happened next. Some people think the emperor wanted to give the hunter something for what he had helped him, the others think the kindness of the hunter had touched the emperor’s heart…”</p>
<p> Yangui’s eyes suddenly lighted up, and his expression of despited became even more obvious.</p>
<p>“Actually, it was the hunter, he forced the emperor to do that.</p>
<p>While trying to escape, the emperor looked at the sky, seeing the clouds and the wind surging and surging, he knew the empress would come, there weren’t any other choices. The only thing he could do, is begging for mercy:</p> 
<p>“If you let me go, I will give you whatever you want.”</p>
<p>The hunter was poor, but of course, he wasn’t an idiot. He knew all of the rumors and the stories that people usually talked about, gods, fairies and demons. He couldn’t help himself from being greedy. What should he request from a god? Being immortal? Having a house that’s full of gold and gems? Marrying a pretty woman? But in this world, who enjoys gaining wealth without having the authorities?</p>
<p>No… He wanted to be an emperor!</p> 
<p>The heavenly emperor couldn’t believe that a mortal person could be that greedy, so he refused immediately.</p> 
<p>“Well… so I won’t let you go!” The hunter said.</p>
<p>Anyway, he had been fighting and hunting many dangerous creatures in the mountains, he also had his own cunning…”</p>
 <p>“Huhh… the emperor was like a dragon that was stuck in a cage. After all, at that time, he was only a rabbit under the knife of that hunter.” Yangui said as he sat down, kept laughing so hard.</p> 
 <p>“That idea popped up in the mind of that deceitful hunter, it turned out that he didn’t match with his honest appearance at all.</p> 
 <p>He said “I don’t only want to become the emperor, I also want my children, my descendants, all of them, to become the emperors. I want to become an emperor of a wealthy, powerful dynasty, which doesn’t have wars, doesn’t have disasters. There will be no one trying to invade from the outside, no one trying to hide the intrigues from the inside. The south doesn’t have to deal with the deluges, the north doesn’t have to deal with the drought and hunger, there’s just only a wealthy and peaceful kingdom. And most importantly, the throne of our Chu family must last for a hundred years, my descendants will be wealthy, prosper, their reputations must be spreaded and last forever.”</p>
 <p>Good, how good… just an unoticed hunter having an inmensity greed, but he had already made the emperor speechless.”</p>
 <p>“And then what happened next?” A little, curious ghost climbed out of the group, he tilted his head up.</p> 
 <p>“What had happened next is…” Yangui looked at the ghost, then smiling when he saw the heavy clouds from the sky that night. “Isn’t it obvious that the next dynasty was Chu?”</p> 
 <p>The emperor had been coerced too much that he couldn’t find any other choices. Later then, the contemporary dynasty of that time was in chaos. The Chu family, with the king of heaven's help, won every battle they had joined. Among a common family, they jumped up, and became the emperor of their own dynasty.</p> 
 <p>“Ah… never known there’s such a thing like that happened.” The other ghosts started discussing “Sangmo, did you make this story to fool us?”
 <p>Yangui, who was called Sangmo, however didn’t answer. He slightly turned his head, his face, which had been made up meticulously, looking like it was being hidden behind the dim light of the candle. He waited for the ghosts until they stopped talking, then continued:</p>
 <p>“The hunter had lived his life in wealth after that, however, he died miserably.”
 <p>The rainy clouds were slowly hiding the moon, the sky was fully covered with darkness, it was hard to see even just a tiny star far away from the horizon. But seemed like Yangui’s mood was getting better, that dismal smile silently appeared in his face again.</p>
 <p>“He died while suffering from his own brutality.”
 <p>The greed was too intense that even his soul couldn’t bear it, finally, he had to use his own desire to destroy himself.</p>
 <p>“How can y’all think the heavenly emperor would accept that request?” Sangmo was about to say, as he glanced at the ghosts. But in an instant, a cold gust of wind outside the shrine blew through the room, sweeping the sands and stones up to the sky. The wind kept rising stronger, sounding like a dreary moaning of a ferocious ghost, blowing out the candlelight immediately. The ruined, old door of the shrine started being hitted, slamming loudly outside. The air was gradually freezing, as it filled someone with the cold of the <span style="color:red">Forgetting river*</span>. Sangmo had not been feeling his heartbeat anymore for a long time, but right now, he felt like he was more and more out of breath, as his heart was beating and beating forcefully, as something on his throat wanted to jump out. Even those ghosts who looked fierce at first, right now, started trembling uncontrollably.</p>  
 <p>And suddenly in the darkness, something was slowly moving. Then, when someone tried to stab it with a silver blade, it released a bright, scarlet color. They only recognised what it was till they got closer, that thing, finally, was a petal from the <span style="color:red">Bi’an flower*.</span></p>
 <p>“AAAAH…” Someone suddenly realised what that meant, he screamed in an extreme fear, quickly quitting into the darkness. The others also followed him, and just after a while, there was only Sangmo inside the shrine.</p>
 <p>“It’s you again.”</p>
 <p>In his gray eyes, suddenly, something flashed and disappeared just in a glimpse, Sango shook his head, facing the boundless darkness, and slowly finished the story: "Of course, the emperor of heaven wouldn’t fully bear that request, in the end, he let some demons coming to the mortal realm, and the fall of Chu dynasty began.”</p>
